# Landing Page Appy
Landing page developed in HTML and Tailwindcss, inspired by [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1222100666260862670) free figma template.

The idea is to have a tailwindcss example, showing the possibilities applied to the real world.

⚠️ This project in this state (html + tailwindcss) shoud not be deployed in production. Instead, use it inside an vite framework or similar.
